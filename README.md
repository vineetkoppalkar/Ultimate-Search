# Ultimate-Search
This is a program that can quickly open and search a topic in a variety of popular websites (Google, Amazon, Newegg, etc). It was created in order to reduce amount of clicks required to find a result. After typing a search request and clicking the "Search" button, the program will automatically opens Google Chrome, navigates to the selected website, enters the search request and continues to the webpage.

## Objective
The objective of this personal project was to learn how to use Serlenium in order to automate websites and to create a modern GUI with Java Swing.

## Requirements
- This program only works with Chrome which is why the "chromedriver.exe" must be installed and placed in the root directory
- If the code is executed in an IDE, then the Selenium may be required
